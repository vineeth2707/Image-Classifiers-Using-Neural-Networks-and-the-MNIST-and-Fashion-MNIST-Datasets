# Image-Classifiers-Using-Neural-Networks-and-the-MNIST-and-Fashion-MNIST-Datasets
Developed neural network-based image classifiers for digit and fashion recognition using MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. Achieved high accuracy with MLP and CNN models, using TensorFlow and Kera’s. Tools: Python, TensorFlow, Kera’s, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of neural networks for image classification tasks.

## Datasets
- **MNIST**: Handwritten digits dataset.
- **Fashion MNIST**: Clothing images dataset.

## Objective
- Build and evaluate neural network models for image classification.

## Key Sections
1. **Data Preprocessing and Exploration**:
   - Load and preprocess the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets.
2. **Model Design and Training**:
   - Create a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for classification tasks.
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate and analyze the performance of the trained models.
